   That can be done with *clojure.core/add-watch*.
   Watcher in that scenario will grab new content and write it via
   AHC, or alternatively will *clojure.core/send-off* to execute
   IO operation in separate thread.

** DONE Cleanup namespaces                                             :rel1:
*** async.http.client
    Should contain helper functions to call all HTTP verbs.
    Default set of call-backs.
*** async.http.client.request
    Lower level of requesting:
    - execute-request
    - prepare-request
** DONE Release 0.1.0                                                  :rel1:

** DONE Release 0.2.0                                                  :rel3:
   Changes:
   - Stream as seq
   - Streams used instead of byte vectors (issue-1)
   - keyworded maps are used in api
*** DONE Create a changelog                                            :rel3:
** DONE Release 0.2.1
   Release bumps version of async-http-client to v1.3.2.
** DONE Make tests stand-alone                                         :rel1:
   Test suite should not fail when there is now hello-www on port 8080.
** DONE Simplify request preparation                                   :rel1:
   For now fns like GET will call prepare-get that will call
   prepare-reqeust. I don't think prepare-get is necessary,
   should be quite fine to only use *prepare-request*.
** DONE Use last argument as key worded map                            :rel3:
   As suggested by [[http://blog.licenser.net/][Licenser]] on #clojure [[http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-07-08.html#i25][here]].
** DONE Review documentation                                           :rel3:
** DONE Refactoring [1/1]                                              :rel3:
*** DONE Refactor *execute-request* [2/2]
**** DONE Build checkable promise
     To check if promise was delivered use *delivered?*
**** DONE Unify *execute-request* and *consume-stream* interfaces
     - Use new checkable *promise* for different parts of response
     - Use normal map for response instead of (ref {})
     - Provide helper functions to deal with metadata on response
** DONE Rename to *http.async.client*                                  :rel3:
