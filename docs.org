* Quick start
  If you just want to use it already.
** Dependency
   Declare dependency in your project.clj:
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (defproject your-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
       :description "Your project description"
       :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                      [http.async.client "0.5.0"]])
   #+END_SRC
   Make sure that your project depends on at least 1.3.0 Clojure as
   *http.async.client* will not run in earlier versions.
** Require
   Require it from your code:
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (ns your.ns (:require [http.async.client :as http]))
   #+END_SRC
** GETting
   To get HTTP resource:
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
       (let [response (http/GET client "http://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client/")] ; request http resource
         (-> response
             http/await     ; wait for response to be received
             http/string))) ; read body of response as string
   #+END_SRC
* Detailed start
** Work modes
*** Asynchronous operations
    When you do:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (http/GET <client> url)
    #+END_SRC
    Result will be a map of [[http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/promise][*clojure.core/promise*]]s, and represents
    response.

    Following HTTP methods have been covered so far:
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-GET][GET]]
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-POST][POST]]
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-PUT][PUT]]
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-DELETE][DELETE]]
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-HEAD][HEAD]]
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-OPTIONS][OPTIONS]]
    For detailed description see [[*HTTP%20methods][HTTP methods]].

    You can submit options to HTTP methods as keyworded arguments,
    like this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (http/GET <client> url :query {:key "value"})
    #+END_SRC
    Following options are supported:
    - *:query* :: query parameters
    - *:headers* :: custom headers to be sent out
    - *:body* :: body to be sent, allowed only with [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-PUT][PUT]]/[[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-POST][POST]]
    - *:cookies* :: cookies to be sent
    - *:proxy* :: proxy to be used
    For detailed usage of options see [[*Request%20options][Request options]].

    Response map contains following keys:
    - *:status* :: promise of lazy map of status fields
      - *:code* :: response code
      - *:msg* :: response message
      - *:protocol* :: protocol with version
      - *:major* :: major version of protocol
      - *:minor* :: minor version of protocol
    - *:headers* :: promise of lazy map of headers where header names are
                    keyworded, like *:server* for example
    - *:body* :: promise of response body, this is ByteArrayOutputStream, but you
                 have convenience functions to convert it for example to string:
                 #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
                   (http/string (http/GET <client> <url>))
                 #+END_SRC
    - *:done* :: promise that is delivered once response receiving
                 is done
    - *:error* :: promise, if there was an error you will find Throwable here
*** Streaming
    For consuming HTTP streams use:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (http/stream-seq <client> :get url)
    #+END_SRC
    Response here is same as in [[*%20Asynchronous%20operations][Asynchronous operations]] but *:body*
    will be lazy sequence of ByteArrayOutputStreams.

    You can still use convenience functions like *http/string* for body,
    but remember that you are dealing now with *seq*.

    For more details please see [[*Lazy%20sequence][Lazy sequence]].
*** Raw mode
    This allows you to provide callbacks that will get triggered on HTTP
    response events like:
     - received status line,
     - received headers,
     - received body part,
     - completed request,
     - handle error.
    All callbacks are expected to return tuple with first element
    been a value to be delivered for given response processing phase,
    second element is controlling execution and if you make it
    *:abort* than processing response is going to be terminated.

    For detailed information on how to use this mode please see [[*Low%20level][Low
    level]].
** HTTP methods
   HTTP methods and convenience functions to request them.
*** GET
    Most basic invocation of [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-GET][*http.async.client/GET*]] is only with
    *url* you want to get.
    Extended invocation includes options that can be any options
    accepted by [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.request.html#var-prepare-request][*http.async.client.request/prepare-request*]]
    [:headers :query ..].

    Simple invocation:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client "<your url>")
              status (http/status resp)
              headers (http/headers resp)]
          (println (:code status))
          (http/await resp)
          (println (http/string resp))))
    #+END_SRC

    Invocation with query parameters:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client "<your url>" :query {:param-name "some-value"})
              status (http/status resp)
              headers (http/headers resp)]
          (println (:code status))
          (http/await resp)
          (println (http/string resp))))
    #+END_SRC

    Invocation with proxy:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client "<your url>"
                             :query {:param-name "some-value"}
                             :proxy {:host host :port port})
              status (http/status resp)]
          (println (:code status))
          (http/await resp)
          (println (http/string resp))))
    #+END_SRC

    Invocation with cookies:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client "http://localhost:8123/cookie"
                             ;; Send cookie
                             :cookies #{{:domain "http://localhost:8123/"
                                         :name "sample-name"
                                         :value "sample-value"
                                         :path "/cookie"
                                         :max-age 10
                                         :secure false}})]
          (doseq [cookie (http/cookies resp)] ; Read cookies from server response
            (println "name:" (:name cookie) ", value:" (:value cookie)))))
    #+END_SRC
    Notice [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-cookies][*http.async.client/cookies*]] function extracts cookies from
    response headers, so to start processing it you don't need to wait
    for whole response to arrive.
*** PUT/POST
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-PUT][*http.async.client/PUT*]]/[[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-POST][*http.async.client/POST*]] work the same
    way as [[*GET][*GET*]] but they also accept *:body* argument.

    *:body* can be:
    - String,
    - map, sent as form parameters,
    - vector, sent as multipart message,
    - input stream,
    - java.io.File, this will be sent using zero byte copy.
**** Submitting body as String
     You can send String as body with PUT/POST:
     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>" :body "SampleBody")]
           ;; do something with resp
           ))
     #+END_SRC
**** Submitting form parameters
     Submitting form parameters is done via body map:
     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>" :body {:u "user" :p "s3cr3t"})]
           ;; do something with resp
           ))
     #+END_SRC
**** Submitting multipart messages
     To send multipart messages in body use vector of maps.
     Each map describes one multipart part.

     Every map has to have *:type* key.

     Following values for *:type* are recognized:
     - :string ::
       Will send named string value in multipart part.
       Map spec:
       - :name :: *required*, name of field sent in multipart part,
       - :value :: *required*, value of field sent in multipart part,
       - :charset :: *optional*, default *UTF-8*, charset used to encode
                     value of field set in multipart part.

       Example of string part in use:
       #+begin_src clojure
         (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
           (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>"
                                 :body [{:type    :string
                                         :name    "field-name"
                                         :value   "field-value"
                                         :charset "UTF-8" ; this is optional,
                                                 ; and contains default value
                                         }])]
             ;; do something with resp
             ))
       #+end_src
     - :file ::
       Will send named file in multipart part.
       Map spec:
       - :name :: *required*, name of field sent in multipart part,
       - :file :: *required*, java.io.File, whose contents will be
                  sent as field value,
       - :mime-type :: *required*, mime-type of /Content-Type/ of this
                       multipart part.
       - :charset :: *required*, charset of /Content-Type/ of this
                     multipart part.

       Example of file part in use:
       #+begin_src clojure
         (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
           (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>"
                                 :body [{:type      :file
                                         :name      "field-name"
                                         :file      (File. "file/to/send.txt")
                                         :mime-type "text/plain"
                                         :charset   "UTF-8"}])]
             ;; do something with resp
             ))
       #+end_src
     - :bytearray ::
       Will send named byte array part.

       Map spec:
       - :name :: *required*, name of field sent in multipart part,
       - file-name :: *required*, filename of /Content-Disposition/,
       - data :: *required*, byte array containing data to sent as
                 field value,
       - :mime-type :: *required*, mime-type of /Content-Type/ of this
                       multipart part.
       - :charset :: *required*, charset of /Content-Type/ of this
                     multipart part.

       Example of *:bytearray* in use:
       #+begin_src clojure
         (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
           (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>"
                                 :body [{:type      :bytearray
                                         :name      "field-name"
                                         :file-name "file-name.txt"
                                         :data       (.getBytes "contents" "UTF-8")
                                         :mime-type  "text/plain"
                                         :charset    "UTF-8"}])]
             ;; do something with resp
             ))
       #+end_src

     To send request with multiple multiparts *:body* vector needs to
     contain multiple maps:
     #+begin_src clojure
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/POST client "<your url>"
                               :body [{:type    :string
                                       :name    "field1-name"
                                       :value   "field-value"
                                       :charset "UTF-8" ; this is optional,
                                               ; and contains default value
                                       }
                                      {:type      :file
                                       :name      "field2-name"
                                       :file      (File. "file/to/send.txt")
                                       :mime-type "text/plain"
                                       :charset   "UTF-8"
                                       }
                                      {:type      :bytearray
                                       :name      "field3-name"
                                       :file-name "file-name.txt"
                                       :data       (.getBytes "contents" "UTF-8")
                                       :mime-type  "text/plain"
                                       :charset    "UTF-8"}])]
           ;; do something with resp
           ))
     #+end_src
**** Submitting body as InputStream
     Another method to provide body is via InputStream:
     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
       (use '[clojure.java.io :only [input-stream]])
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/PUT client "<your url>" :body (input-stream (.getBytes "SampleContent" "UTF-8")))]
           ;; do something with resp
           ))
     #+END_SRC
**** Submitting body as File, a.k.a. zero byte copy
     To use zero byte copy future, provide a File as :body
     #+begin_src clojure
       (import '(java.io File))
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/PUT "<your url>" :body (File. "<path to file>"))]
           ;; do something with resp
           ))
     #+end_src
*** DELETE
    To call [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-DELETE][*http.async.client/DELETE*]] on a resource:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/DELETE "<your url>")]
          ;; do something with resp
          ))
    #+END_SRC
*** HEAD
    To call [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-HEAD][*http.async.client/HEAD*]] on a resource:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/HEAD "<your url>")]
          ;; do something with resp
          ))
    #+END_SRC
*** OPTIONS
    To call [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-OPTIONS][*http.async.client/OPTIONS*]] on a resource:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/OPTIONS "<your url>")]
          ;; do something with resp
          ))
    #+END_SRC
** Request options
   Following options can be provided to requests and are defined by
   [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.request.html#var-prepare-request][*http.async.client.request/prepare-request*]]:
   - [[*:query][:query]] :: query parameters
   - [[*:headers][:headers]] :: custom headers to be sent out
   - [[*:body][:body]] :: body to be sent, allowed only with PUT/POST
   - [[*:cookies][:cookies]] :: cookies to be sent
   - [[*:proxy][:proxy]] :: proxy to be used
   - [[*:auth][:auth]] :: authentication map
   - [[*:timeout][:timeout]] :: timeout configuration
*** :query
    Query parameters is a map of keywords and their values. You use
    it like so:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :query {:key1 "value1" :key2 "value2"})]
          (http/await resp)
          (http/string resp)))
    #+END_SRC
*** :headers
    Custom headers can be submitted same way as [[*:query][:query]]:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :headers {:header-name1 "value1"
                                                  :header-name2 "value2"})]
          (http/await resp)
          (http/string resp)))
    #+END_SRC
*** :body
    Body can be provided with a message only with [[*PUT/POST][PUT/POST]], it
    doesn't make sense to have body with other [[*HTTP methods][HTTP methods]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/PUT client url :body "sample body")]
          (http/await resp)
          (http/string resp)))
    #+END_SRC
    *:body* can be:
    - String,
    - map, sent as form parameters,
    - vector, sent as multipart message,
    - input stream,
    - java.io.File, this will be sent using zero byte copy.

    Please see [[*PUT/POST][PUT/POST]] for more documentation.
*** :cookies
    Cookies can be provided to request as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client "http://localhost:8123/cookie"
                             :cookies #{{:domain "http://localhost:8123/"
                                         :name "sample-name"
                                         :value "sample-value"
                                         :path "/cookie"
                                         :max-age 10
                                         :secure false}})]
          (http/await resp)
          (http/string resp)))
    #+END_SRC
    *:cookies* option takes sequence of cookie maps, in this example
    a hash set.
    Cookie map consist of:
    - *:domain* :: Domain that cookie has been installed
    - *:name* :: Cookie name
    - *:value* :: Cookie value, note that there is no additional
                  processing so you should encode it yourself if
                  needed.
    - *:path* :: Path on with cookie has been installed
    - *:max-age* :: Max age that cookie was configured to live
    - *:secure* :: If cookie is secure cookie

    Cookie reading is described in [[*Reading cookies][Reading cookies]].
*** :proxy
    Proxy can be configured per request basis as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :proxy {:host h :port p})]
          (http/await resp)
          (http/string resp)))
    #+END_SRC
    Proxy expects a map with following keys:
    - *:host* :: proxy host
    - *:port* :: proxy port
    - *:protocol* :: /optional/ protocol to communicate with proxy.
                     Can be *:http* (default) or *:https*.
    - *:user* :: /optional/ user name to use for proxy authentication.
                 Must be provided with :password.
    - *:password* :: /optional/ password to use for proxy
                     authentication.
                     Must be provided with :user.
*** :auth
    Authentication can be configured per request basis.
    For now BASIC and DIGEST methods are supported.

    Basic method is default, so you don't have to specify it:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :auth {:user u :password p})]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Though you can:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :auth {:type :basic :user u :password p})]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    And for digest method you will need realm as well:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url
                             :auth {:type :digest :user u :password p :realm r})]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Controlling preemptive authentication behavior is also possible:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :auth {:user u :password p :preemptive true})]
          ;; process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
*** :timeout
    Response timeout can be configured per request as well.
    Timeout value is time in milliseconds in which response has to be
    received.
    There is special value *-1* that indicates infinite timeout.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :timeout -1)]
          (http/await resp)
          ;; process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will wait until response is fully received, as long
    as it takes (-1 timeout).
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url :timeout 100)]
          (http/await resp)
          (if (http/failed? resp)
            ;; did not get response in configured timeout
            ;; process response
            )))
    #+END_SRC
    Example above configures timeout to 100ms, so *await* will only
    wait for 100ms, after that response is done.
    Which doesn't necessarily mean that it was delivered to client
    successfully, because it was restricted by timeout, that is why
    example contains check if response has failed.
** Streaming
   HTTP Stream is response with chunked content encoding.
   Those streams might not be meant to ever finish, see twitter.com
   streams, so collecting those responses as a whole is impossible,
   they should be processed by response parts (chunks) as they are
   been received.

   Two ways of consuming a HTTP Stream are supported:
   - [[*Lazy sequence][Lazy sequence]]
   - [[*Call-back][Call-back]]
*** Lazy sequence
    You can get HTTP Stream as lazy sequence of it's body.
    This is very convenient method as *seq* is native type of Clojure
    so you can apply all mapping, filtering and any other standard
    function that you like to it.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/stream-seq client :get url)]
          (doseq [s (http/string resp)]
            (println s))))
    #+END_SRC
    *stream-seq* arguments:
    - http method :: any of supported methods can be used, though it
                     makes sense only to use *:get*, *:put* and
                     *:post*
    - url :: URL of HTTP resource
    - options :: same as normal [[*Request%20options][Request options]].

    It is important to understand that seqs returned by *body* or
    *string* (which in turn calls body) are backed by queue.
    One of consequences of it is that once you consumed some body
    parts they will not be available anymore.
    Let's see code speak for itself.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (let [resp (http/stream-seq :get url)]
        (println "1: " (first (http/string resp)))
        (println "2: " (first (http/string resp))))
    #+END_SRC
    This code will print following:
    : 1: part1
    : 2: part2
    Assuming that part1 is first chunk and part2 is second.

    Second consequence of been directly backed by queue is that you
    can have multiple consumers of same response and non of them will
    get same body part.

    And finally this implementation is not holding to it's head.
*** Call-back
    Consuming HTTP Stream with call-back is quite straight forward with
    *http.async.client*. You will need to know what HTTP Method you will call,
    what URL and provide a call back function to handle body parts been
    received.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [parts (ref #{})
              resp (http/request-stream client :get url
                                        (fn [state body]
                                          (dosync (alter parts conj (string body)))
                                          [body :continue]))]
          ;; do something to @parts
          ))
    #+END_SRC

    Few notes on implementing body part callback:
 - state is a *map* with *:status* and *:headers* as promises, at
   stage when you get called for body part, both of them should be in
   place already, though it is advised to use convenience methods to
   read them, see [[*Reading%20status%20line][Reading status line]] and [[*Reading%20headers][Reading headers]],
 - call-back has to follow guidelines described in [[*Body%20part][Body part]],
 - some streams are not meant to be finished, in that case don't
   collect body parts, as for sure you will run out of available
   resources,
 - try not to do any heavy lifting in this callback, better send it
   to agent.
** Response handling
   *http.async.client* exposes some convenience functions for
   response handling.
*** Awaiting response
    If you call any of [[*Asynchronous%20operations][Asynchronous operations]], [[*Streaming][Streaming]] or [[*Raw%20mode][Raw mode]]
    you actually asynchronously execute HTTP request.
    Some times you might need to wait for response processing to be
    done before proceeding, in order to do so you call
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-await][*http.async.client/await*]].
    It takes only one argument, that is response and returns once
    receiving has finished.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          (http/await resp)))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will behave like synchronous HTTP operation.
    For convenience it returns same response so you can use it
    further, for example like that:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          (http/string (http/await resp))))
    #+END_SRC
*** Reading status line
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-status][*http.async.client/status*]] returns status lazy map of response.
    It will wait until HTTP Status has been received.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp   (http/GET client url)
              status (http/status resp)]
          (:code status)))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will return HTTP response status code, notice that
    after this returns headers and body, might not been delivered
    yet.
*** Is redirect?
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-redirect%3F][*http.async.client/redirect?*]] checks if response is redirect.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/await (http/GET client url))]
          (when (http/redirect? resp)
            (println "Response is redirect."))))
    #+END_SRC
*** Reading headers
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-headers][*http.async.client/headers*]] returns headers lazy map of response.
    It will wait until HTTP Headers are received.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp    (http/GET client url)
              headers (http/headers resp)]
          (:server headers)))
    #+END_SRC
    Again, like in case of status, body might not have been delivered
    yet after this returns.
*** Reading content-type
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-content-type][*http.async.client/content-type*]] returns value of *Content-Type*
    header.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp         (http/GET client url)
              content-type (http/content-type resp)]
          (println "Content-Type of response:" content-type)))
    #+END_SRC
*** Reading location
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-location][*http.async.client/location*]] will return redirect target if
    response is redirect.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)
              loc  (http/location resp)]
          (println "Location of redirect:" loc)))
    #+END_SRC
*** Reading cookies
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-cookies][*http.async.client/cookies*]] returns seq of maps representing
    cookies.
    It will wait until HTTP Headers are received.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp    (http/GET client url)
              cookies (http/cookies resp)]
          (map :name cookies)))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will return sequence of cookie names that server has
    set.
*** Reading body
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-body][*http.async.client/body*]] returns either ByteArrayOutputStream or
    seq of it, depending if you used [[*Asynchronous%20operations][Asynchronous operations]] or
    [[*Streaming][Streaming]] respectively.
    It will *not* wait for response to be finished, it will return as
    soon as first chunk of HTTP response body is received.
*** Reading body as string
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-string][*http.async.client/string*]] returns either string or seq of
    strings, again depending if you used [[*Asynchronous%20operations][Asynchronous operations]] or
    [[*Streaming][Streaming]] respectively.
    It will *not* wait for response to be finished, it will return as
    soon as first chunk of HTTP response body is received.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          (http/string (http/await resp))))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will return string of response body.
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-string][*http.async.client/string*]] is lazy so you can use it in case of
    streams as well.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp    (http/stream-seq client :get url)
              strings (http/string resp)]
          (doseq [part strings]
            (println part))))
    #+END_SRC
    Sample above will print parts as they are received, and will
    return once response receiving is finished.
*** Reading error
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-error][*http.async.client/error*]] will return Throwable that was cause of
    request failure iff request failed, else *nil*.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          (http/await resp)
          (when-let [err (http/error resp)]
            (println "failed processing request: " err))))
    #+END_SRC
*** Canceling request
    At any given time of processing HTTP Response you can *cancel* it
    by calling [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-cancel][*http.async.client/cancel*]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          (http/cancel resp)))
    #+END_SRC
    Please see *canceling-request* test.
*** Response predicates
    You can also check status of request.
**** done?
     [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-done?][*http.async.client/done?*]] will tell you if response processing
     has finished:
     #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
       (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; Create client
         (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
           (when-not (http/done? resp)
             (http/await resp)
             (http/done? resp))))
     #+END_SRC
     Sample above will check if response was finished, if not - will
     wait for it and return true as a result of call to done?.
**** failed?
     [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-failed?][*http.async.client/failed?*]] will return true iff request has
     failed. If this return true you can [[*Reading%20error][read error]].
**** canceled?
     [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-canceled?][*http.async.client/canceled?*]] will return true iff request has
     been [[*Canceling%20request][canceled]], else false is return.
*** Requested URL
    If you need to get URL of response at hand, there are two
    associations in it that you will find useful:
    - :url :: encoded url,
    - :raw-url :: not encoded url.

    And two convenience functions:
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-url][*http.async.client/url*]],
    - [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-raw-url][*http.async.client/raw-url*]].

** Managing client
*** Branding
    *http.async.client* can be configured with User-Agent. To do so
    you can use [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-create-client][*http.async.client/create-client*]] and remember to
    close created client yourself, best is to use it within macro
    like with-open, though make sure that body of it will wait for
    whole response to finish.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :user-agent "Your User Agent/1.0")]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+END_SRC
*** Enabling HTTP compression
    *http.async.client* can be configured to allow, or not, HTTP
    compression.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :compression-enabled true)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Follow redirects
    Enabling HTTP redirects following.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client  (http/create-client :follow-redirects true)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Remove parameters on redirect
  Query parameters are not passed on to any redirect that is followed (by default parameters are removed).
  #+begin_src clojure
  (with-open [client (http/create-client :remove-params-on-redirect true)]
    (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
      ;; do stuff with resp
      ))
  #+end_src
*** Keep alive
    Keep Alive is enabled by default. This implies using pool for
    connections.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :keep-alive true)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Max connections per host
    Maximum number of connections to be cached per host.
    Above this number connections will still be created but will not
    be kept alive.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :max-conns-per-host 10)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Max connections total count
    Maximum number of total connections opened, submitting new
    request while all allowed connections are active, will result in
    rejection.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :max-conns-total 100)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Max redirects to follow
    Maximum number of redirects to follow.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :max-redirects 3)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
*** Timeouts
    With *http.async.client* apart from per connection [[*:timeout][:timeout]] you
    can globally configure *connection*, *request* and *idle*
    timeouts. All timeout values are in milliseconds and magic value
    *-1* is interpreted as infinite wait.
    *idle* connection in pool timeout works only on connections in
    pool, connections idle, for configured time, in pool will be
    closed.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :connection-timeout 10
                                             :request-timeout 1000
                                             :idle-in-pool-timeout 100)]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; request processing
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Example above will timeout connection if it was not established
    in 10ms, request if it was not received in 1sec, or connection
    when it was idling in pool for more than 100ms.
*** Proxy
    Client can be also configured with global HTTP Proxy settings.
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :proxy {:host h :port p})]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; do stuff with resp
          ))
    #+end_src
    Proxy expects a map with following keys:
    - *:host* :: proxy host
    - *:port* :: proxy port
    - *:protocol* :: /optional/ protocol to communicate with proxy.
                     Can be *:http* (default) or *:https*.
    - *:user* :: /optional/ user name to use for proxy authentication.
                 Must be provided with :password.
    - *:password* :: /optional/ password to use for proxy
                     authentication.
                     Must be provided with :user.
*** Authentication
    Default authentication realm to be used globally can be
    configured.
    For now BASIC and DIGEST methods are supported.

    Basic method is default, so you don't have to specify it:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :auth {:user u :password p})] 
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Though you can:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :auth {:type :basic :user u :password p})]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    And for digest method you will need realm as well:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :auth {:type :digest :user u :password p :realm r})]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; Check if response is not 401 or so and process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
    Preemptive authentication can be enabled or disabled globally per client:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client :auth {:type :basic :user u :passowrd p :preemptive true})]
        (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
          ;; process response
          ))
    #+END_SRC
*** SSL Certificates
    Since v0.4.2 it is possible to use SSL certificates with client.

    For client to use SSL you need to provide it with *ssl-context*.
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (require [http.async.client.cert :as cert])
      (let [ctx (cert/ssl-context :keystore-file ks-file
                                  :keystore-password password
                                  :certificate-file cert-file
                                  :certificate-alias other-cert-alias)]
        (with-open [client (http/create-client :ssl-context ctx)]
          (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
            ;; process response
            )))
    #+END_SRC

    For more documentation please consult docstring of
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.cert.html#var-ssl-context][*http.async.client.cert/ssl-context*]] and tests.

*** Closing *http.async.client*
    Whenever you've created *http.async.client* via
    [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-create-client][*http.async.client/create-client*]] you will need to close it.
    To do so you call [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-close][*http.async.client/close*]].
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (let [client (http/create-client)]
        (try
          (let [resp (http/GET client url)]
            ;; process response
            )
          (finally
           (http/close client))))
    #+END_SRC
* Low level
  This is lowest level access to *http.async.client*.
  Mechanics here is based on asynchronous call-backs.
  It provides default set of callbacks and functions to create and
  execute requests.
** Preparing request
   [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.request.html#var-prepare-request][*http.async.client.request/prepare-request*]] is responsible for
   request preparation, like the name suggests.
   It takes following arguments:
  - HTTP Method like *:get* *:head*
  - *url* that you want to call
  - and *options*, a keyworded map described already in [[*Request%20options][Request options]].
    Sample:
    #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)]
        (let [req (request/prepare-request 
                                           :get "http://google.com"
                                           :headers {:my-header "value"})]
          ;; now you have request, next thing to do would be to execute it
          ))
    #+END_SRC
** Executing request
   [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.request.html#var-execute-request][*http.async.client.request/execute-request*]] returns same map of promises
   as [[*Asynchronous%20operations][Asynchronous operations]].
   Its arguments are: request to be executed (result of [[*Preparing%20request][Preparing
   request]]) and *options* as keyworded map consisting of call-backs.
   Following *options* keys are recognized:
   - *:status* :: [[*Status%20line][Status line]]
   - *:headers* :: [[*Headers][Headers]]
   - *:part* :: [[*Body%20part][Body part]]
   - *:completed* :: [[*Body%20completed][Body completed]]
   - *:error* :: [[*Error][Error]]
   All callbacks take response map as first argument and callback
   specific argument if any.
   Callbacks are expected to return tuple of *result* and *action*:
   - *result* :: will be delivered to respective promise in response
                 map
   - *action* :: if its value is *:abort* than response processing
                 will be aborted, anything else here will result in
                 continuation.
*** Status line
    Status line callback gets called after status line has been
    received with arguments:
    - response map
    - Status map has following keys:
      - *:code* status code (200, 404, ..)
      - *:msg* status message ("OK", ..)
      - *:protocol* protocol with version ("HTTP/1.1")
      - *:major* major protocol version (1)
      - *:minor* minor protocol version (0, 1)

    Sample code to illustrate how to use status callback:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [request (request/prepare-request :get "http://example.com") ; create request
              status (promise)                ; status promise that will be delivered by callback
              response (request/execute-request
                        client request        ; execute *request*
                        :status               ; status callback
                        (fn [res st]          ; *res* is response map, same as one returned by *execute-request*
                                              ; *st* is status map, as described above
                          (deliver status st) ; deliver status promise
                          [st :abort]))]      ; return status to be delivered to response map and abort further processing of response.
          (println @status)))                 ; await status to be delivered and print it.
    #+end_src
*** Headers
    Headers callback gets called after headers have been received
    with arguments:
    - response map
    - lazy map of headers. Keys in that map are *(keyword
      (.toLowerCase <header name>))*, so "Server" headers is
      *:server* and so on.

    Sample code to illustrate how to use headers callback:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [request (request/prepare-request :get "http://example.com") ; create request
              headers (promise)               ; headers promise that will be delivered by callback
              response (request/execute-request
                        client request        ; execute *request*
                        :header               ; header callback
                        (fn [res hds]         ; *res* is response map, same as one returned by *execute-request*
                                              ; *hds* is headers map, as described above
                          (deliver headers st) ; deliver headers promise
                          [hds :abort]))]     ; return headers to be delivered to response map and abort further processing of response.
          (println @headers)))
    #+end_src
*** Body part
    Body part callback gets called after each part of body has been
    received with arguments:
    - response map
    - ByteArrayOutputStream that contains body part received.

    Following code sample will show how to count number of body parts
    received:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [cnt (atom 0)                    ; body parts counter
              request (request/prepare-request :get "http://localhost:8123/stream") ; create request
              resp (execute-request
                    *client* request          ; execute *request*
                    :part                     ; body part callback
                    (fn [_ p]                 ; ignore response map,
                                              ; *p* is body part
                      (swap! cnt inc)         ; increment body part counter
                      [p :continue]))]        ; return part to be delivered to response map and continue processing of response.
          (http/await resp)                   ; wait for response to finish
          (println @cnt)))                    ; print body parts counter
    #+end_src

    Next sample will collect body parts:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [parts (atom #{})                ; body parts collector
              request (request/prepare-request :get "http://localhost:8123/stream") ; create request
              resp (execute-request
                    *client* request          ; execute *request*
                    :part                     ; body part callback
                    (fn [_ ^ByteArrayOutputStream p] ; ignore response map,
                                              ; *p* is body part
                      (let [p (.toString part "UTF-8")] ; extract text
                        (swap! parts conj p)  ; collect body part
                        [p :continue])))]     ; return part to be delivered to response map and continue processing of response.
          (http/await resp)                   ; wait for response to finish
          (println @parts)))                  ; print collected body parts
    #+end_src
*** Body completed
    This callback gets called when receiving of response body has
    finished with only one argument, i.e. response map.

    Following snippet shows how to measure execution time:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [request (request/prepare-request :get "http://localhost:8123/") ; create request
              finished (promise)               ; execution time will be stored here
              start (System/currentTimeMillis) ; start time
              resp (execute-request
                    *client* request           ; execute *request*
                    :completed                 ; completed callback
                    (fn [_]                    ; ignore response map,
                      (deliver finished        ; deliver execution time
                               (- (System/currentTimeMillis) start))))]
          (println @finished)))                ; print execution time
    #+end_src

    You have to be aware of fact that *:completed* callback is called
    only on successful response. Next snippet will show that
    *:completed* callback is not called when request errors:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [request (request/prepare-request :get "http://not-existing-host/") ; create request
              finished (promise)               ; would get delivered if :completed callback would get executed
              resp (execute-request
                    *client* request           ; execute *request*
                    :completed                 ; completed callback, will not fire in this example
                    (fn [_]                    ; ignore response map,
                      (deliver finished true)))] ; deliver finished promise
          (http/await resp)                    ; wait for response
          (false? (realized? finished))))      ; finished promise never got delivered
    #+end_src
*** Error
    Error callback gets called when error while processing has been
    encountered with arguments
    - response map
    - *Throwable* that was a cause of failure

    Next code snippet shows error callback in use:
    #+begin_src clojure
      (with-open [client (http/create-client)] ; create client
        (let [request (request/prepare-request :get "http://not-existing-host/") ; create request
              errored (promise)                ; will store exception
              resp (execute-request
                    *client* request           ; execute *request*
                    :error                     ; error callback
                    (fn [_ e]                  ; ignore response map, *e* is exception
                      (deliver errored e)))]   ; deliver errored promise
          (http/await resp)                    ; wait for response
          (println @errored)))                 ; print exception from callback
    #+end_src
** Default callbacks
   [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.request.html#var-*default-callbacks*][*http.async.client.request/*default-callbacks**]] is a map of
   default callbacks. This will allow you to easy change only few
   callbacks and reuse default for the rest.

   Please look at source of [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/doc/http.async.client.html#var-stream-seq][*http.async.client/stream-seq*]] to see
   how to do it.
