** WebSocket client

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure -n

  (:require [http.async.client :as http]))

(def url "ws://remote-websocket-url:1337")

(defn on-open [ws]
  (println "Connected to WebSocket."))

(defn on-close [ws code reason]
  (println "Connection to WebSocket closed.\n"
           (format "[%s] %s" code reason)))

(defn on-error [ws e]
  (println "ERROR:" e))

(defn handle-message [ws msg]
  (prn "got message:" msg))

                             :text handle-message)]
      ; this loop-recur is here as a placeholder to keep the process
      ; from ending, so that the message-handling function will continue to
      ; print messages to STDOUT until Ctrl-C is pressed
      (loop [] (recur)))))
