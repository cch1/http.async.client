  - :headers - promise that once headers are received is delivered, contains lazy map of:
    - :server - header names are keyworded, values stay not changed
  - :body    - body of response, depends on request type, might be ByteArrayOutputStream
               or lazy sequence, use conveniece methods to extract it, like string
