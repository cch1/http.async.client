  Returns a map:
  - :id      - unique ID of request
  - :status  - promise that once status is received is delivered, contains lazy map of:
    - :code     - response code
    - :msg      - response message
    - :protocol - protocol with version
    - :major    - major version of protocol
    - :minor    - minor version of protocol
  - :headers - promise that once headers are received is delivered, contains lazy map of:
    - :server - header names are keyworded, values stay not changed
  - :body    - body of response, depends on request type, might be ByteArrayOutputStream
               or lazy sequence, use conveniece methods to extract it, like string
  - :done    - promise that is delivered once receiving response has finished
  - :error   - promise that is delivered if requesting resource failed, once delivered
               will contain Throwable.
  Arguments:
  - url     - URL to request
  - options - keyworded arguments:
    :query   - map of query parameters
