* Documentation
  This project uses a [[https://gist.github.com/SKempin/b7857a6ff6bddb05717cc17a44091202][git subtree]] in the =gh-pages= directory to hold the generated documentation.  The documentation is generated from two sources:
  + The [[https://github.com/weavejester/codox][lein codox]] plugin
  + The publishing of [[https://orgmode.org/org.html][Org]] files as HTML
* Releasing
  1. Update the code.
  2. Commit code updates.
  3. Update the org file-based documentation in the =./org= directory.
  4. Commit all org file changes.
  5. Push all commits to the remote repository.
  6. Release with =lein release= - this should also generate a tag and push the tag.  For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
lein release patch
#+END_SRC
  7. [@7]Generate the API docs with =lein doc=.
  8. [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Publishing][Publish]] the org docs by:
     1. loading the =org-publish-project-alist.el= file.
     2. Evaluating the Emacs Lisp contents of the file.
     3. Executing ~org-publish-project~ and supplying the project name ~gh-pages~.
  9. In the subtree directory =gh-pages=, commit all generated files.
  10. In the root directory, commit the changed =gh-pages= subtree:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git add gh-pages
git commit -m "Publish documentation"
#+END_SRC
