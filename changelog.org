            Empty response body hangs c/body, c/string

            Documentation update
** Improved logging
   Improved logging configuration for running tests.
** Tested against Clojure 1.4.0-beta1
* Release 0.4.0
** Clojure 1.3 compatible
** Support for multiple values for same key (QString)
   [[https://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client/issues/22][#22]]
** Clojure contrib independent
   [[https://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client/pull/24][#24]]
** Upgrade async-http-client to v1.6.5
* Release 0.3.1
** Upgrade async-http-client to v1.6.4
* Release 0.3.0
** Upgrade async-http-client to v1.6.3
** Control over preemptive authentication
   Patch provided by xeqi.
** Explicit client usage
   Now following functions require client as first argument:
   - GET
   - PUT
   - POST
   - DELETE
   - HEAD
   - OPTIONS
   - request-stream
   - stream-seq
   - execute-request
   You still create client with create-client function.
** Removed with-client macro
   This didn't really bring much value.
   Migration path.
   From:
   #+begin_src clojure
     (with-client {:key val}
       ;; client usage
       (let [resp (GET url)]))
   #+end_src
   To:
   #+begin_src clojure
     (with-open [client (create-client :key val)]
       ;; client usage
       (let [resp (GET client url)]))
   #+end_src
** Clojure 1.2.1
   Fixed cyclic dependency that was preventing http.async.client from
   been used in Clojure 1.2.1.

   Underlying async-http-client has undergone serious optimization
   changes.

** Canceling request
   *http.async.client/cancel* and *http.async.client/canceled?*
** Request timeout
   Per request configuration of request timeout in ms.
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (GET url :timeout 100)
   #+END_SRC
** Close client
   *http.async.client/close*.
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (c/close)
   ;; or
   (c/close hac)
   #+END_SRC
** Upgrade to v1.3.2 of async-http-client
* Release 0.2.0
** Stream as seq
   Response body can be seq, this allows for easy HTTP Stream
   handling. [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/docs.html#sec-1.2.4][Documentation]].
** Cookies
   Added cookies support. [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/docs.html#sec-1.2.3.4][Sending]] and [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/docs.html#sec-1.2.5.4][receiving]].
** Authentication support
   Basic and Digest from rfc2617 are supported. [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/docs.html#sec-1.2.3.6][Documentation]].
** Proxy per request
   Proxy can be specified per request. [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/docs.html#sec-1.2.3.5][Documentation]].
** Branding User-Agent
   Specifying User-Agent per client.
   [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/autodoc/http.async.client-api.html#http.async.client/create-client][*http.async.client/create-client*]] and [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/autodoc/http.async.client-api.html#http.async.client/with-client][*http.async.client/with-client*]].
** Keyworded maps in API
   Like *:options* in [[http://neotyk.github.com/http.async.client/autodoc/http.async.client-api.html#http.async.client/GET][*http.async.client/GET*]].
